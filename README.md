# TellStick Server

This is the software running on the late generation TellStick ZNet Lite and
TellStick Net

## Prerequisites

This software is only supported under Linux and macOS.

Although most of the prerequisites can be installed sandboxed, locally in the
project folder, there are some libraries that must exist on the system.

The following applications must be available:
* python (2.7)
* virtualenv
* Node.js
* Npm

### Linux

In many Linux distributions the packages for `python` and `virtualenv` already exist.
On a Debian/Ubuntu based system these can be installed using this command:

    sudo apt-get install python virtualenv

If `virtualenv` is not available on your system, you can install it with either
`pip` or `easy install`:

    sudo pip install virtualenv

or

    sudo easy_install virtualenv

### macOS

Pyhon is already shipped on macOS. You only need to install `virtualenv` using:

    sudo easy_install virtualenv

## Setup

To setup the source and prepare the base plugins run the following script:

    ./tellstick.sh setup

This vill create a `virtualenv` folder under the `build` folder and download
and install the required libraries for running the software.
The installation is completely sandboxed and nothing is installed in the system.
You can wipe the `build` folder at any time to remove any installed packages.

## Running

Start the server by issuing:

    ./tellstick.sh run

By default the server will restart itself any time it detects a file has been
modified.

To install a plugin run:

    ./tellstick.sh install [path-to-plugin]

Replace `[path-to-plugin]` with the path to the plugin root folder.

## Documentation

Build the documentation:

    ./tellstick.sh build-docs
